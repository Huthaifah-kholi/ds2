# Applied Data Science (DS2)
* Preparation: code in this training will be in both R and Python. If you are unfamiliar with R, you should take these two short MOOCs before the training starts: [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-r-data-science-microsoft-dat204x-3) and [Programming with R for Data Science](https://prod-edx-mktg-edit.edx.org/course/programming-r-data-science-microsoft-dat209x-2). Both courses are free if you do not need a certificate.
* Outline: [tentative outline](DataScience2Outline.pdf)
* If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.
