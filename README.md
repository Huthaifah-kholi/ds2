# Applied Data Science (DS2)
* Planned start date and time: April 8, 2017, 1:30PM (at CCE, Masa bldg, 6th floor in Ramallah). For registration, see the [Ad at Ritaj](https://ritaj.birzeit.edu/bzu-msgs/msg?mid=1330550)
* __Trainer's notes__: will be available at [ADS (Applied Data Science)](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/ADS) repository. This is [Session 1](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/ADS/tree/Module-1-Introduction-to-the-course). Note: html files may display as source (markup) on GitHub. You can either download (or clone) the branch or use an online viewer like [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). In RawGit, you should paste the address of the html source. The RBasics notebooks above may also help as a quick R review. A good source on caret (R's equivalent to Scikit-Learn in Python) is [the caret package](http://topepo.github.io/caret) site (by the author of Caret). There is also a book online called [R for Data Science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) by an active R contributor. Here's another good [introduction to caret](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/conferences/useR-2013/Tutorials/kuhn/user_caret_2up.pdf).
* Prerequisite: [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) or demonstrated equivalent knowledge and skills (through assessment).
* Preparation: code in this training will be in __both R and Python__ (new candidates: you also need to install the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python - see [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) for more details). If you are unfamiliar with R, you should take these two short MOOCs before the training starts: [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-r-data-science-microsoft-dat204x-3) and [Programming with R for Data Science](https://prod-edx-mktg-edit.edx.org/course/programming-r-data-science-microsoft-dat209x-2). Both courses are free if you do not need a certificate. For a full R reference, check [The R Book](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/TheRBook.pdf) 2nd edition (available for free). Install R from the [CRAN site](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can also install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) if you want. However, most work will be in the Jupyter notebook you already know. To enable R in Jupyter notebooks, you need to install [IRKernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). __Run the IRKernel installation commands from the R prompt__. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9a9Jj2A95g) if you need help. Another option is to use [R Essentials](https://conda.io/docs/r-with-conda.html). For help on Jupyter notebooks in general, see [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). Here's also a [video tutorial on Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk). For machine learning work, check this [Scikit-Learn and Caret packages cheatsheet](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/cheatsheet-scikit-learn-caret-package-for-python-r-respectively/)
* Comparing R and Python: read this [Infoworld article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3187550/data-science/python-vs-r-the-battle-for-data-scientist-mind-share.html). See also the [reply to this article](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/850125412873195520) by Hadley Wickham, an active R contributor. 
* Outline (subject to adjustments): [tentative outline](DataScience2Outline.pdf). 
* The course (48 training hours) will focus on practical cases and will include different algorithms and data types (including text and images). Trainees also work on a project and present it at the end of the training.
* If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.
* Datasets and general resources: see resources and datasets in the [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) part. Also, check this [Kaggle wiki](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Satendra) for additional links. If you haven't seen an iris, check [this tweet](https://twitter.com/48nnews/status/851882368768061440)
* You should have a GitHub account by now (create one if you don't). Also, make sure you follow the [trainer](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak) on GitHub (access to all repositories). You can also __star__ or __watch__ a repository. You) for Jupyter users. also need to know a bit of markdown notation  here's a [Markdown cheat sheet](http://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/markd-jupyter.html) for Jupyter users.
* Data Science ethics: in addition to resources in [DS1](../../../ds1/), see this blog and keynote speech: [Keynote on Ethical Machine Learning](http://kjamistan.com/pydata-amsterdam-keynote-on-ethical-machine-learning/)
* Projects: you are advised to start working on your final project as early as possible (first week of training). Local data is preferred. Groups of 2 are preferred (1 and 3 are allowed exception). Level of work is proportional to group size.
