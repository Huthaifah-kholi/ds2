# Applied Data Science (DS2)
* Preparation: code in this training will be in __both R and Python__. If you are unfamiliar with R, you should take these two short MOOCs before the training starts: [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-r-data-science-microsoft-dat204x-3) and [Programming with R for Data Science](https://prod-edx-mktg-edit.edx.org/course/programming-r-data-science-microsoft-dat209x-2). Both courses are free if you do not need a certificate. Install R from the [CRAN site](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can also install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) if you want. However, most work will be in the Jupyter notebook you already know. To enable R in Jupyter notebooks, you need to install [IRKernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). __Run the IRKernel installation commands from the R prompt__. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9a9Jj2A95g) if you need help. Another option is to use [R Essentials](https://conda.io/docs/r-with-conda.html). For help on Jupyter notebooks in general, see [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). Here's also a [video tutorial on Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk).
* Outline: [tentative outline](DataScience2Outline.pdf)
* If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.
