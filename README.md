## Updates: 
May 11, 2017: __Projects presentations__ are planned for May 20th at 1:30 PM. You are expected to brief your trainer on your progress during session 8. Your near-final work should be ready on github on or before the 17th of May, 2017. Make sure to document your work and add an ethics section.   
May 7-11, 2017: added a new file on [data science ethics resources](DSEthics.md) and uploaded an example on sentiment analysis in Keras (using Word2Vec).   
May 4, 2017: Session 7-8 material is online: open links from [ADS (Applied Data Science)](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/ADS). Tip: to practice, clone or download [branch](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/ADS/tree/Module-7--Deep-Learning)   

## Info and Resources  
* Planned start date and time: April 8, 2017, 1:30PM (at CCE, Masa bldg, 6th floor in Ramallah). For registration, see the [Ad at Ritaj](https://ritaj.birzeit.edu/bzu-msgs/msg?mid=1330550)
* __Trainer's notes__: available at [ADS (Applied Data Science)](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/ADS) repository. Use the ReadMe file for links to sessions and sub-sessions. 
Note: html files may display as source (markup) on GitHub. You can either download (or clone) the branch or use an online viewer like [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). In RawGit, you should paste the address of the html source. The RBasics notebooks above may also help as a quick R review. A good source on caret (R's equivalent to Scikit-Learn in Python) is [the caret package](http://topepo.github.io/caret) site (by the author of Caret). There is also a book online called [R for Data Science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) by an active R contributor. Here's another good [introduction to caret](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/conferences/useR-2013/Tutorials/kuhn/user_caret_2up.pdf). There is also a [caret wiki](https://github.com/tobigithub/caret-machine-learning/wiki).
* Prerequisite: [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) or demonstrated equivalent knowledge and skills (through assessment). You can also [watch this 2-part training session](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/05/learn-machine-learning-10-days.html) for beginners. Parts of the (updated) online book [Python for Scientists and Engineers](http://pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/) should also be useful. Here's also a [collection of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks) in different subjects.
* Preparation: code in this training will be in __both R and Python__ (new candidates: you also need to install the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python - see [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) for more details). If you are unfamiliar with R, you should take these two short MOOCs before the training starts: [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-r-data-science-microsoft-dat204x-3) and [Programming with R for Data Science](https://prod-edx-mktg-edit.edx.org/course/programming-r-data-science-microsoft-dat209x-2). Both courses are free if you do not need a certificate. For a full R reference, check [The R Book](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/TheRBook.pdf) 2nd edition (available for free) and [Awesome R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R) which has a great list of resources (also links to [Awesome ML](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning). Install R from the [CRAN site](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can also install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) if you want. However, most work will be in the Jupyter notebook you already know. To enable R in Jupyter notebooks, you need to install [IRKernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). __Run the IRKernel installation commands from the R prompt__. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9a9Jj2A95g) if you need help. Another option is to use [R Essentials](https://conda.io/docs/r-with-conda.html). Python notebooks can also run R cells using [rpy2](http://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/introduction.html#getting-started). For help on Jupyter notebooks in general, see [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). Here's also a [video tutorial on Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk). More on [Jupyter project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgSf62XNNxk) - good to know. Also watch out for [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) - a nice IDE. For machine learning work, check this [Scikit-Learn and Caret packages cheatsheet](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/12/cheatsheet-scikit-learn-caret-package-for-python-r-respectively/) - see this [interactive map](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/) for scikit-learn algorithms. More on [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) and [related projects](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/related_projects.html). There is also an [Azure ML cheat sheet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet) and [infographic with examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-basics-infographic-with-algorithm-examples). For Anaconda, here's a [conda cheat sheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf). For deep learning, see [this collection](http://p.migdal.pl/2017/04/30/teaching-deep-learning.html).
* Comparing R and Python: read this [Infoworld article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3187550/data-science/python-vs-r-the-battle-for-data-scientist-mind-share.html). See also the [reply to this article](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/850125412873195520) by Hadley Wickham, an active R contributor. Another good source is this [Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238726/how-do-r-and-python-complement-each-other-in-data-science) question. 
* Outline (subject to adjustments): [tentative outline](DataScience2Outline.pdf). 
* The course (48 training hours) will focus on practical cases and will include different algorithms and data types (including text and images). Trainees also work on a project and present it at the end of the training.
* If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.
* Datasets and general resources: see resources and datasets in the [Data Science Foundations](../../../ds1/) part. Also, check this [Kaggle wiki](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Satendra) for additional links. If you haven't seen an iris, check [this tweet](https://twitter.com/48nnews/status/851882368768061440)
* You should have a GitHub account by now (create one if you don't). Also, make sure you follow the [trainer](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak) on GitHub (access to all repositories). You can also __star__ or __watch__ a repository. You) for Jupyter users. also need to know a bit of markdown notation  here's a [Markdown cheat sheet](http://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/markd-jupyter.html) for Jupyter users.
* __Misc resources__: [Data Science ethics](DSEthics.md), is your machine learning model [wrong?](https://boltdata.io/blog/2016/11/27/4-reasons-your-machine-learning-model-is-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/), model [evaluation metrics](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/7-important-model-evaluation-error-metrics-everyone-should-know), how to [win a data science competition](https://www.slideshare.net/jeongyoonlee/winning-data-science-competitions-74391113) and how to [approach machine learning problems](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/07/21/approaching-almost-any-machine-learning-problem-abhishek-thakur/), on how [logistic regression](https://opendatascience.com/blog/how-the-multinomial-logistic-regression-model-works/) works - in Python.
* __Feature extraction__: from text, see [nltk book](http://www.nltk.org/book/), scikit-learn and [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html). More text resoources (global WordNets and others) can be found at [Princeton page](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/related-projects/), [TALP resources](http://www.talp.upc.edu/index.php/technology/resources), [The SAI](https://www.thesai.org) - search for Arabic!. Also, you can refer to [Stanford NLP with deep learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) class with [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6). NLP [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), [software and data](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/) also available. More Arabic resources: [SLSA: A Sentiment Lexicon for Standard Arabic](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D15/D15-1304.pdf), [OMA Project](http://oma-project.com/), [Arabic sentiment analysis](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/ArabicSA.html), [Lab41](https://gab41.lab41.org/tagged/deep-learning), [Arabic data and resources repo](https://github.com/hadyelsahar/large-arabic-sentiment-analysis-resouces).   For images, try [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/) and check [openCV](http://opencv.org/). For sound/audio, you can use [LibRosa](http://librosa.github.io/) or [PyAudio](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis). Here's an [audio dataset](https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/index.html) from Google research. The [CREAM lab](http://cream.ircam.fr/) is also relevant. For image data and deep learning / NNs, see [Image-Net](http://image-net.org/explore) and [FastAI](http://www.fast.ai/) - nice MOOC.
* Projects: you are advised to start working on your final project as early as possible (first week of training). Local data is preferred. Groups of 2 are preferred (1 and 3 are allowed exception). Level of work is proportional to group size.
* __Technology and real life DS__: you should familiarize yourself with computational limits and solutions (big data and distributed file systems, parallel processing, using GPU and cloud computing). You can use cloud resources on different platforms for free (limited time and computing power). For example, [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net) offers free trials and you can start from [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-create-experiment). Azure ML has drag/drop and GUI interface for model creation, training and publishing (prediction via API). See [this screenshot](azureml.png). The [Cortana Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/) is also a good resource of ML solutions. Machine learning is now integrated with databases like MS SQL server 2017 - see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFzrRyca_HU) for more (ex. demo at 12 min). Examples from ML as a service (API) like face recognition and translation: [Microsoft cognitive services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) and [Google cloud services](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/).
