# Notes by Ak 

These scripts were adapted from [ULMFiT](https://github.com/n-waves/ulmfit-multilingual/tree/master/ulmfit) to work 
with google colab. Some fixes were added to allow all to be in one folder (fast_contrib.x -> fast_contrib_x).  
They are likely to end within the fast ai distribution.  
The author has [refactored them](https://github.com/n-waves/ulmfit-multilingual/tree/refactor/ulmfit) and they 
seem under heavy work (as of Dec. 3, 2018). 
Managed to create ar wiki and trained model, but could not run train_clas.py due to [weights issue](https://github.com/n-waves/ulmfit-multilingual/issues/20)
